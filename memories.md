# Memories
+ (Jon Berliner) The Friendsgiving crew cheltenham friends were the closest thing I had to family in high school.  When Gabe's family sold the house, I felt like I lost my family home.  There was a night we went over and "jammed" aka riley and gabe jammed on piano and that indian accordian thinger (name please), and the rest of us got to sing along and do drum circles.  someone, i think adam, brought out yarn and ran around the room, spinning a web around all of us.  i remember feeling nearly delirious with joy - sincerely internally on the edge of talking in tongues, while onthe outside reminding myself to keep some of that joy to myself, because i didn't want to ruin the moment by making it about me.

+ (Jon Berliner) I asked Riley how to hop from rock to rock when water hiking (my family would never let us do family activities growing up - only watching movies or tv together, or going to my mom's parents' house in toledo were allowed - so I had to learn how to appreciate nature from a combo of middle school PEAK trip (not to be confused with Sam "Don't Tell me What's Real" Kassel's peak trip at the Soltrin cabin)), some curated nature walks at Camp Ramah, and winging it trying to keep up with all you guys' awesome naturing abilities.  Riley looked confused laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said something along the lines of "uuuh, you kinda just walk!" and laughed.  Thanks for making it a joyous moment instead of one I felt embarassed to ask about
    + Also, asked Riley how to do a flip once, and he told me "try really really really hard."  I, actually really sincerely, use that advice for so many things in life still.  It's a hilariously effective way to teach yourself how to do something.  Thanks, Riley!

+ (Jon Berliner) at some point at Camp Ramah or during a meet up at a USY event, Deshields and I had a discussion about perching ourself on chairs as the most comfortable way to sit.  I can't remember if I started "perching" before or after we talked about it, but that convo still pops up in my head every single time.

+ (Jon Berliner) Three Scoot Sunday was our Razor scooter gang.  Zach and Bowman ended up getting harassed by cops for scootin' like the hoodlums they are at pre-dawn hours from elementary school to elementary school.  They were being grilled by cops about if they were breaking into cars and stealing stuff.  They told the cops they were scooting around drinking coffee and visiting schools.  The cop let them off, telling them that was so dumb that they couldn't possibly be making it up.

+ (JB) I was at summer camp around 10, my first summer.  I was walking with Capecci to Friday night services at Ramah, both rocking our finest khaki bottoms (mine were shorts, I think).  I mumbled "looks like the Dairy Queen burnt down again" drolly, don't remember if there was a reason why.  Pech ended up wheezing with laughter.

+ (JB) Diane's basement drinking Smoked beers Joe brought to us from Philly Beer week.  Pretty sure I was buzzed at this point when we made up my high school yearbook quote "A chair-eating bear is a bear eating chair."  I attributed it to "Honest" Abe Lincoln.

+ (JB) Drop in and drop in at Gabe's house.  The first time someone hung out in the garage, they "had" to drop in on the halfpipe he built.  I don't know how to skate, but whatever let's try.  I ended up stomping on the board, freaking out and grabbing the garage rails thinger on the ceiling, hanging with one hand on it in the air, and then falling into near middle the ramp.  My tailbone was not happy, but it was really funny.

+ (Adam Drake) Lying in JB's extra bed (Ben's ?) trying to go to sleep on a weekend sleepover - JB recommends I imagine a dancing icecream cone. Some time goes by and he asks me how I imagined it. I said there was an ice cream cone in a room - digital 70s technicolor color schemes - it was grooving. JB said his was a grid of infinite expanding ice cream cones dancing in space. I frequently use his ice cream cones in times of sleepy troubles.

    + (JB riffing): Adam, how old were we?  Earliest things I can remember from our sleepovers was discussing the universe and if it's infinite or how it's going to end and how small we are around 12-13.  Born explorers of the infinite, bb!


+ (Adam Drake) bags of sunflower seeds - endless foot spirals down and around elizabeth into the night - why never ranch? always original.
    
+ (JB) LeShawn and I were discussing how people who have been through a lot of shit are, in Shawn's words, "hoarders of thoughts."  This turned into a discussion about generational continuation of abuse, and the plight of the progeny of pimps.  Realized a pimp is a "hoarder of thots."  Good times pacing the hallway up and down together
